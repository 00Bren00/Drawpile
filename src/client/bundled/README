Notes on bundled libraries:

KArchive
--------

This is a stripped down (only ZIP support included) version of KF5 KArchive with Qt 5.0 compatibility hacked in.
It is included for the benefit of platforms where newer Qt versions or the KArchive library are not available.
The bundled version is used only if the library is not found.
