Notes on bundled libraries:

KArchive
--------

This is a stripped down (only ZIP support included) version of KF5 KArchive with Qt 5.0 compatibility hacked in.
It is included for the benefit of platforms where newer Qt versions or the KArchive library are not available.
The bundled version is used only if the library is not found.

KArchive homepage: https://projects.kde.org/projects/frameworks/karchive


kis_cubic_curve
---------------

This is taken from Krita's source code. It is currently not available in library form.


QtColorTriangle
---------------

This is from the Qt solutions package. Upstream doesn't seem to be alive anymore.
The designer plugin has been updated to work with Qt 5
