The icons are divided into two categories: theme and builtin.
Icons from the theme category are normally got from the system theme (Linux only)
with the bundled icons as fallbacks. Some of the theme icons are not actually part
of any theme at the moment, but they could be:

 * draw-line: standard name, but not found in many (any?) themes
 * draw-watercolor: unstandard name, looking for a better icon
 * tool-laserpointer: unstandard name

The builtin icons are for things specific to this app.
