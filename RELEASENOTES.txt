Release notes for DrawPile 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second release of DrawPile, now with networking support.
Session hosting and joining is now supported, but session administration
commands like board locking and kicking users are not.

The client can start the server automatically if both binaries are in
the same directory. The server can also be started manually (with the -l
parameter) and then connected to using the "host on remote server: localhost"
option.

Please note that this is still alpha software. There might be bugs that
crash drawpile or  drop the network connection, so remember to save your
work often!
