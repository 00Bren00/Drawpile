To compile DrawPile, Qt 4.2 or newer is required.

Installation steps.
1. mkdir build (in the project root directory)
2. cd build
2. cmake ..
3. make
The executables are generated in bin/ directory. You can run them from there,
or run "make install" to copy the files to the appropriate system directories.

If you don't need the standalone server, you can pass the option -DSERVER=off
to cmake. If you want to develop DrawPile, you can enable the debugging features
with -DDEBUG=on
