To compile DrawPile, Qt 4.2 or newer is required.

Installation steps.
1. mkdir build (in the project root directory)
2. cd build
2. cmake ..
3. make
The executables are generated in bin/ directory. You can run them from there,
or copy them to, for example, /usr/local/bin. Remember to copy libdrawpilenet.so
from lib/ directory to the appropriate library path (e.g. /usr/local/lib) as well.

Running make install is not supported at the moment.

If you don't need the standalone server, you can pass the option -DSERVER=off
to cmake. If you want to develop DrawPile, you can enable the debugging features
with -DDEBUG=on
