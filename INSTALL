DrawPile is still in a very early stage of development, so automatic
installation is not yet supported.
To compile DrawPile, Qt 4.2 is required. Go to src/ subdirectory
and run "qmake && make".
The client should be built in the client/ subdirectory and the server in server/

A better build system is hopefully on its way...
