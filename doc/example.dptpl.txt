# This is a minimal session template example.
# This template creates a session with a blank 1200x1200px canvas with
# a white background layer and a transparent foreground layer.
#
# A session template works just like a regular hibernated session, except
# it is not removed once the session ends. A hibernated session either
# goes back to sleep or is removed when the last user leaves, but a
# template session resets back to its starting point. I.e. the live
# session ends and the template it was started from becomes visible again.
#
# You can create a session template in two ways: by making a copy of a
# hibernated session or manually using a file like this.
#
# To turn this file into a working template, convert it to the binary
# recording format using the txt2dprec tool:
#
# txt2dprec --title "Session title" --founder "Session founder name" example.dptpl.txt session.example.dptl
#
# Place the output file into the server's hibernation directory.
# Note: the filename must follow the naming scheme "session.ID.dptl"
# ID may contain letters (a-Z), numbers (0-9) and the characters ':' and '-'
#
# The server must be started with hibernation support enabled. To do this,
# set the hibernation directory:
#
# drawpile-srv --hibernation <hiberation directory path>

# A session must begin with a "resize" command to set the initial canvas size.
resize 1 0 1200 1000 0

# Create default layers
newlayer 1 1 0 #ffffffff Background
newlayer 1 2 0 #00000000 Foreground

# See textloader.md for the full list of supported commands
